### About the Project
It is noticed that whenever we lose something on campus, we have to run to the Lost and Found department and look for it there, and at times the item reaches there after we have already visited it once. Hence, a web app would be helpful to provide information about this. It will be simple and elegantly designed. There will be a login page, and then there will be two options to choose from: find a lost item or report an item that is found and belongs to someone else. Then there will be multiple options to choose from, including basic items such as ID Cards, Mobile Phones, wallets, ATM cards, notebooks, and others. If someone has to report a found item, they can either select identifiable or anonymous, and they can also provide their contact information if they want the owner to contact them, or else they can submit it to the lost and found department and tell the owner to claim it from there. The owner can prove their identity and claim the item.  
> The web app will be built using React JS and MongoDB as a database. The final app will be containerized using Docker and deployed on AWS EC2.
