# OSoC-Lost-And_Found-WebApp
A webapp for the university that will ease the process of retrieving lost items. It is a big problem when you lose valuable items, and in that scenario, it becomes helpful if you are able to see through a list of items found lately, and luckily, if you do find your item there, then you save a lot of time and sweat. So what are you waiting for?
